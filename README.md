# I DRIVE

I Drive is a racing game built on PCG (procedural content generation) for track generation, aimed at addressing the high repetitiveness and limited content of traditional racers. By developing a highly configurable, finely tunable track-generation system and pairing it with action-racing mechanics reminiscent of the Mario Kart series, it delivers an experimental game with high entertainment value and strong replayability.

I Drive’s core gameplay is racing. Players aim to clear each course within a set time and earn a Gold or Silver Cup based on their performance. Beyond basic acceleration, cars support a variety of flashy stunts—such as drifting, ramp jumps, and stunt boosts. With precise inputs, players can push their car’s performance, adding both fun and challenge.
